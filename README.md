## Color Picker
The color picker is used to pick a color, and then can be crafted with items to color them the right color. To open up the GUI, right click the color picker. You then can click and move the point in the color wheel, and the saturation slider at the bottem. The color result will be rendered onto the item on the left. To exit the GUI, press escape. <br>
The Color Picker also can be used to color these items:
 - Paintbrush
 - Painting Boots
 - Throwable paint
 - Leather Armour
<br>To color those items, simply put one of the items, and the color picker (with the picked color) into a crafting table **There is currently a bug where the crafting recipe does not check how many items are in the crafting table, meaning you can put 2 color pickers in the table, or 2 of the item you want to color**<br>
